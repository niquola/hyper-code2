// what makes a page addressable at all — the workspace looks for exactly one
// data-page to know what it is showing, and a page that forgets it cannot be
// pointed at, toured or reported by page.state.
// `right` is what belongs TO the heading rather than to the page under it — a
// help button, a switch over the whole screen. `ui.box` calls the same slot the
// same thing.
