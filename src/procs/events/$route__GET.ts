// GET /events — long-lived Server-Sent Events stream.
// Every page opens one; the server pushes reload / custom events down it. The
// stream doubles as presence: it begins when a tab opens and ends when it
// closes, which is a better answer to "who is here" than anything a heartbeat
// could give.
// `?topics=agent:eh,agents` narrows the stream SERVER-side: a tab watching one
// agent is not woken by every other agent's traffic. Global events (reload,
// notify) still reach everybody — see procs.events.emit.
/**
 * Handle the GET request for the events route.
 * @param opts.req The incoming HTTP request.
