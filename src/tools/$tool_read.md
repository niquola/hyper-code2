  Read a file, optionally a line range. With hashline the lines come back prefixed with stable
  anchors — read that way when you intend to edit the file afterwards.

### `§read`

Two body forms are supported.

Shorthand body:
    src/foo.ts

Structured body:
    path: src/foo.ts
    startLine: 120
    endLine: 180

or:
    path: src/foo.ts
    maxLines: 80

Structured keys:
- `path` — required
- `startLine` — optional, 1-based
- `endLine` — optional, inclusive
- `maxLines` — optional cap on returned lines

Rules:
- If the body is a single line with no `:`, it is treated as the path shorthand.
- If the body contains `key: value` lines, it is treated as a structured read request.
- For plain `§read`, line options return only that slice as plain text.
- Any unknown key is an error, so a typo surfaces instead of becoming part of the path.

Result:
    §result:read:src/foo.ts
    ...raw file text...

If you use a structured body, the result header echoes the original body verbatim after `§result:read:`.

### `§read:hashline`

Same body rules. Result rows carry an anchor per line:

    §result:read:hashline:src/foo.ts
    11a|first line
    22b|second line

Use this before `§edit` — the anchors are what an edit addresses.
