description: >-
  Search file contents. Returns ripgrep-style rows — "path:line:column: text", context lines as
  "path-line- text". Respects .gitignore and skips binaries. With hashline the line number is
  replaced by a stable anchor, ready to use with edit. path may be a directory or a single file.
marker: grep
promptSnippet: "search file contents (respects .gitignore)"
promptGuidelines:
  - "Search in hashline mode when you want anchors from the search results to edit with."
  - "Use literal:true to search for text that contains regex characters instead of escaping them."

### `§grep`

Body is key/value lines:
    pattern: normalizeUser
    path: src
    glob: **/*.ts
    limit: 20
    ignoreCase: true

Supported keys: `pattern` (required), `path`, `glob`, `literal`, `ignoreCase`, `context`,
`limit`, `noIgnore`, `hidden`.

Result rows:
    §result:grep
    src/x.ts:12:5: matched line text

### `§grep:hashline`

Same request shape; the rows carry anchors instead of line numbers:

    §result:grep:hashline
    src/x.ts:12ab:5: matched line text

Useful when you want searchable anchors for later editing.
