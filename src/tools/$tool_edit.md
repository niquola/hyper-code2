description: >-
  Edit an existing file in place. `path` names the file, `edits` lists the changes. The usual
  edit is a literal replacement — oldText must appear exactly once unless all is set. Anchored
  edits address lines by the anchors a hashline read returns, and are refused if the anchor moved.
marker: edit
validate: tools.editValidate
promptSnippet: "edit files in place"
promptGuidelines:
  - "An edit replaces exact text, so copy oldText verbatim from what you read, including indentation, and give enough of it to be unique."
  - "Several changes to one file belong in one edit call with several entries in edits, not in several calls."

### `§edit` / `§edit:hashline`

The marker form takes the anchored script as its body — it is translated into the same
structured edits the tool takes. `§edit` is shorthand for `§edit:hashline`.

Rules:
- Read the file first with `§read:hashline`.
- Copy anchors exactly.
- The first non-blank line must be `@PATH`.
- Payload lines must start with `|`.

Ops:
- `+ ANCHOR` — insert after anchor
- `< ANCHOR` — insert before anchor
- `- A..B` — delete range
- `= A..B` — replace range
- `= A` — replace one line
- `replace "old" "new"` — literal replacement; requires exactly one match
- `replace-all "old" "new"` — replace every literal match; requires at least one
- Replace arguments are JSON strings, so use `\n`, `\"`, and `\\` escapes as needed.

Example body:
    @src/foo.ts
    = 22ab
    |const x = 1;

Result:
    §result:edit:hashline
    edited src/foo.ts (123 bytes)
