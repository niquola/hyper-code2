  Find files by glob pattern, honouring .gitignore. Returns matching paths. Use this instead of
  shelling out to `find` — a walk over a home directory takes minutes and usually times out.
promptSnippet: "find files by glob (respects .gitignore)"
promptGuidelines:
  - "Look for files with find, not with bash `find` — it is faster and skips node_modules and build output."
parameters:
  type: object
  properties:
    pattern:
      type: string

    limit:
      type: integer
      description: "Maximum paths to return (default 200). You are told when the limit is hit."
    noIgnore:
      type: boolean
      description: "Search everywhere, ignoring .gitignore — node_modules, build output, vendored code."
    hidden:
      type: boolean
      description: "Include dotfiles and dot-directories."
    timeout:
      type: integer
