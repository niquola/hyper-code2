// A declared tool: what a `mod/$tool_<name>.md` (or `.json`) file says.
//
// Declaration and implementation are SEPARATE on purpose:
//
//   mod/$tool_read.md   the declaration — schema, docs, prompt contributions.
//                       Data, not code: it is the JSON Schema that ships to the
//                       provider verbatim, and it is diffable as prose.
//   mod/read.ts         the implementation — an ordinary procs function, so it
//                       is callable by hand (`ctx.fns.tools.read({ path })`),
//                       from §eval, and from other modules, not only by a model.
//
// The `.md` form carries the declaration as YAML frontmatter and the wire-format
// documentation as the markdown body; `.json` is the same fields with no prose.
// The implementation defaults to `<module>.<name>` and is overridable with `fn`.
